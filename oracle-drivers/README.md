# Notes

When building images within enterprise domain, direct access to the Internet may not be allowed. If build environment is air-gapped, the `Visual C++ Redistributable package` should be downloaded manually.
If there is a proxy that can be used, you can [use proxy to pull resources](../pull-resources-vi-proxy/README.md) from the Internet.
